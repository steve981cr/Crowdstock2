CrowdStock
==========================

The purpose of this application is to crowdsource stock information. This was created at AngelHack Silicon Valley the summer of 2014.

## Inspiration
A new study from the City University of Hong Kong, Purdue University, and Georgia Institute of Technology show that the
“wisdom of the crowds” phenomena provided by crowdsourcing applies to the stock market as well.
